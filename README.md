# Pardus Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wbayer/pardus-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wbayer/pardus-android) #
Pardus for Android, available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.pardus.android.browser), is a convenient web client for the [massive multiplayer online game Pardus](https://www.pardus.at/). Besides the standard browser component its features are:

## Local images ##
An image pack is downloaded at the application's first start. Subsequently images are loaded only from the local image pack, saving expensive mobile network traffic and improving performance.

## Extensibility ##
Support of Greasemonkey-compatible user scripts make Pardus fully customizable on your Android phone.

## Secure access ##
By default all data from and to the Pardus servers is securely sent through HTTPS. Links unrelated to Pardus are opened in a new browser application without access to sensitive data. Optionally you can set the app to log your account out of Pardus whenever it loses focus.

## Fast access ##
If you choose to save your account credentials, you are automatically logged in at the app's startup. A floating menu bar instead of two frames saves space, and the customizable links let you browse through pages more quickly.
